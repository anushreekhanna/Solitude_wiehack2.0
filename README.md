# **`SolitAR:`** Our team's submission to WieHack2.0's AR/VR division.

We wanted to create a more realistic way to try on jewellery items using a smart phone camera. According to a survey we did, most people would prefer having some way to try on items such as rings before spending a lot of money. 61% of our surveyed consumers would prefer to shop online where an AR catalog would be present and 40% would pay more if they had the chance to experience a product through AR firsthand.

Tools used:
* Blender for 3D modelling
* C# scripting to allot characteristics to each object
* Unity + Vuforia Engine to attach each object with its C# script and mount it to the desired location in 3D space.
* Android Studio: To create the Android AR application.

_WIP: More jewellery designs including rings, bracelets, earrings, etc._
